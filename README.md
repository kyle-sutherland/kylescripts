# Kyle's Shell Scripts

Welcome to my collection of personal shell scripts! Here, you’ll find various scripts I’ve written to automate tasks, customize my environment, and solve little problems. Whether you’re here for inspiration or just curious about what’s under the hood, I hope you find something useful!

## What's Inside

Each script is unique and aims to simplify or automate everyday tasks. Feel free to explore and adapt them for your own use. I’ll try to keep everything well-organized and documented, so don’t hesitate to dive in. Pay attention to the shebang at the top of each script! I wrote most of these when I still used bash, and bash scripts are still my default but some of them will only work in zsh.

## Repository Organization

This repository mirrors my `~/.scripts` directory structure, organized to make these scripts easy to find and use:

- **`./crons`**: Contains scripts scheduled to run automatically as cron jobs. These scripts handle routine tasks, maintenance, and other scheduled activities.

- **`./path`**: Contains scripts designed for interactive use. These are aliased and added to my user path for quick access, so I can run them from anywhere with ease.

This setup keeps things organized and ensures that each script has a specific purpose and place.

## Suggestions Welcome

If you spot an improvement, have an idea, or just want to share your thoughts, contributions are more than welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
